# 🚗 Car Price Analysis – U.S. Market (Multiple Linear Regression)


## 📊 Project Aim

The purpose of this project is to explore the factors that influence car pricing in the U.S. automotive market, which may differ significantly from other regions.

The goal is to:

+ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

+ Build a multiple linear regression model

+ Check model assumptions (linearity, normality, multicollinearity, etc.)

+ Interpret the results in the context of market-driven pricing behavior

📄 Full analysis available in the following [notebook](https://github.com/ybarnatan/multiple-lin-reg/blob/main/Multiple-linear-regression.md).
